DeepZoomImageConverter v0.1
Author: Don Liang (dl2k84@gmail.com)

This is a program written in the Scala programming language
similar to the Microsoft Deep Zoom Composer program
that converts images (JPEG, PNG) to the
Microsoft Deep Zoom image format
which is part of the Silverlight framework.
See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645050%28v=vs.95%29.aspx

The converted images produced by this application can then be
viewed by any application written in Silverlight that works with the
Deep Zoom format, or my very own DeepZoomViewer
(see https://github.com/dl2k84/DeepZoomViewer)

If you have a Scala development environment set up with Java runtime support,
the application can be started by invoking the main class with arguments:
liang.don.dzimageconverter.ImageConverterMain ImageURL FileFormat
where
ImageURL is the location of the image and
FileFormat is the format of the file (acceptable formats: jpg, png)

Alternatively, build a jar specifying the above class as the main class.

Otherwise please refer to the BUILD-HOWTO file on how to get this
project built and running.

v0.1 is an initial publish so there is no doubt redundant and inefficient code.
This will be optimized and refactored in future revisions.
