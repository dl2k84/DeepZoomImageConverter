DeepZoomImageConverter TODO
Author: Don Liang (dl2k84@gmail.com)

- Decide how to handle converting mixed jpg/png image sources as an
  image collection as the XML schema only allows setting  one image format.
- Detect .jpeg extensions as JPEG files (currently only supports .jpg).
- Investigate a better scaling algorithm. Scaled down images with my converter
  using Bicubic Interpolation does not look as nice as the ones generated by
  Microsoft Deep Zoom Composer.
- UI
- Unit tests
